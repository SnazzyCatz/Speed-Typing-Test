var med = ["The ice sheet also plucked and rounded Burke Mountain into the shape it possesses today. The many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode. Less than one million years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over Burke Mountain in a southeastward direction.Since Since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must have been formed quite recently, that is, geologically speaking. The scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders. Did you ever hear about the Great Ice Age or the Pleistocene Epoch? What can explain these striations and their common orientation?"
  , "In the same way, if one treats themselves badly, being treated badly by someone else is not going to be any different. Or, one could end up putting up with what is taking place, and they will end up feeling even worse. It is then going to be important for them to take a closer look into what is taking place. Being treated in this way would cause them to feel uncomfortable, and they would soon walk away. Through being this way, they are naturally going to need to take a bit of time to settle down. Having them in their life is then going to be a way for them to avoid how they feel."
  , "She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She's resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called. It was easy to spot her. All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion."
  , "Knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't. I haven't bailed on writing. Look, I'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track. I am making an effort. I will start writing consistently again!"
  , "They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue. Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging."
  , "The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. While many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part of history. It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future. It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next."

You want to look, but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear and unable to act. That's where she found herself and she didn't know what to do next. It went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness, and could not, for the life of him, tell whether he held the sheep right side up, or upside down."
  , "I've rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which is just north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua Tree. We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back. All he could think about was how it would all end. There was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics were there for anyone to see."
  , "There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he didn't understand where it came from. It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him. It's not his fault. I know you're going to want to, but you can't blame him. He really has no idea how it happened."
  , "The document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention.I'm I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this moment. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it's easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction."
